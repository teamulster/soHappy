## Motivation
This Android app is based on the [Remember to smile - design of a mobile affective technology
to help promote individual happiness through smiling](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318014342_Remember_to_smile_-_design_of_a_mobile_affective_technology_to_help_promote_individual_happiness_through_smiling)
paper by George Moore, Leo Galway and Mark Donnelly, which theorizes that more frequent genuine
smiling can substantially improve happiness. With technology improving over the years, it has been
made possible to measure an individual's happiness through Affective Computing, which allows a more
objective evaluation than more traditional methods, such as questionnaires.

Not only is pursuing happiness deeply integrated into our roots, it has also been proven that
increased happiness is associated with higher productivity, well-being and quality of life,
prompting well known organizations such as the World Health Organization to support happiness
as an important factor to an individual's overall health.

## Methodology
Previously, happiness was measured using a wide variety of approaches that were primarily
defined by the respective creator's belief in factors contributing to happiness. As such, they
are plagued by subjectivity, which somewhat diminishes their potential to effectively
assess happiness. Techniques carried out by computers have been shown to be capable of providing
more objective results. For this reason, the aforementioned paper proposed a mobile application
designed to encourage genuine smiling.

Upon launching the app, the user will be asked to move their face into the camera frame. As soon as
a face has been detected, a short countdown is started in order to give the user an opportunity to
relax. After the countdown has passed, another, longer countdown is started and a text message is
shown on the screen, serving as a stimulus for a genuine smile. The user is given feedback every
second whether a smile has been recognized or not. Detected smiles are used to calculate the total
duration and probability of a genuine smile. During the entire process, the camera frame is
blurred to reduce feelings of self-consciousness, greatly reducing the likelihood of fake smiling.

Once the second countdown has passed, a set of questions are posed to the user. These range from
questions concerning the user's current evaluation of their own happiness to the user's recent
activities. After all questions have been answered, the user will be presented with a screen in
which they are thanked for their participation.
