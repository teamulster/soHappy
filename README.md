## Motivation

This Android app is based on the [Remember to smile - design of a mobile affective technology
to help promote individual happiness through smiling](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318014342_Remember_to_smile_-_design_of_a_mobile_affective_technology_to_help_promote_individual_happiness_through_smiling)
paper by George Moore, Leo Galway and Mark Donnelly, which theorizes that more frequent genuine
smiling can substantially improve happiness. With technology improving over the years, it has been
made possible to measure an individual's happiness through Affective Computing, which allows a more
objective evaluation than more traditional methods, such as questionnaires.

Not only is pursuing happiness deeply integrated into our roots, it has also been proven that
increased happiness is associated with higher productivity, well-being and quality of life,
prompting well known organizations such as the World Health Organization to support happiness
as an important factor to an individual's overall health.
